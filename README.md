# PhpBB Extension - marttiphpbb Forum Style

[Topic on phpBB.com](#)

## Requirements

* phpBB 3.2.1+
* PHP 7.1+

## Features

This phpBB extension adds classes in the form of `forum-ID` to Prosilver to indicate to which forum posts belong (Replace `ID` with the actual forum-id-number). This way posts or topics belonging certain forum can be given an alternative style (like a different background color). For applying the style itself, i.e the [Extra Style Extension](https://github.com/marttiphpbb/phpbb-ext-extrastyle) can be used.
To know to which HTML elements the `Forum-ID` classes are added, search with the Web Developer Inspector tool of your browser.
This extension has no configuration.
